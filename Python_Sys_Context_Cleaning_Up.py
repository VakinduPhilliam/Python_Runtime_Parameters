# Python sys — System-specific parameters and functions.
# This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact
# strongly with the interpreter.
# contextlib — Utilities for with-statement contexts.
# This module provides utilities for common tasks involving the with statement. 
# Cleaning up in an __enter__ implementation.
# As noted in the documentation of ExitStack.push(), this method can be useful in cleaning up an already allocated resource
# if later steps in the __enter__() implementation fail.
# Here’s an example of doing this for a context manager that accepts resource acquisition and release functions, along with
# an optional validation function, and maps them to the context management protocol:
 
from contextlib import contextmanager, AbstractContextManager, ExitStack

class ResourceManager(AbstractContextManager):

        self.acquire_resource = acquire_resource

        if check_resource_ok is None:
            def check_resource_ok(resource):
                return True

            yield

            # The validation check passed and didn't raise an exception
            # Accordingly, we want to keep the resource, and pass it
            # back to our caller

            stack.pop_all()
