# Python sys — System-specific parameters and functions.
# This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact
# strongly with the interpreter.
# inspect — Inspect live objects.
# The inspect module provides several useful functions to help get information about live objects such as modules, classes,
# methods, functions, tracebacks, frame objects, and code objects. 
# inspect.getcallargs(func, *args, **kwds). 
# Bind the args and kwds to the argument names of the Python function or method func, as if it was called with them.
# For bound methods, bind also the first argument (typically named self) to the associated instance.
# A dict is returned, mapping the argument names (including the names of the * and ** arguments, if any) to their values from
# args and kwds. In case of invoking func incorrectly, i.e. whenever func(*args, **kwds) would raise an exception because of
# incompatible signature, an exception of the same type and the same or similar message is raised. For example:
 
from inspect import getcallargs
    def f(a, b=1, *pos, **named):
        pass

    getcallargs(f, 1, 2, 3) == {'a': 1, 'named': {}, 'b': 2, 'pos': (3,)}   # Displays 'True'

    getcallargs(f, a=2, x=4) == {'a': 2, 'named': {'x': 4}, 'b': 1, 'pos': ()}  # Displays 'True'

    getcallargs(f)
