Python Runtime Parameters.
This series of Python scripts is written to demonstrate the use of the sys module (sysâ€” System-specific parameters and functions). 
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. The module is always available.
